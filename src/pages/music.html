        description="Music has been a part of my life ever since my mom placed speakers on her tummy and played Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty. I still play the tenor saxophone bought by my grandfather from a shop in Manhattan back in 1993. Nowadays I can call myself a mutli-instrumentalist, arranger, composer and performer working across industries such as broadcast TV, mobile game development, indepenednt video and film production. I continue to explore, write and record in Brooklyn."

      <p class="tp-audio-block--description">Check out my latest composition 'Linger and Lurk' on Soundcloud. This song falls in the ilk of such songs as Stevie Wonder's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gkqGCnK-nw" target="_blank">Creepin'</a> as it is about the haunting visits for people from your past via dreams. Stylistically this song is inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNYTYS_gnMY">any of the many wonderful</a> tunes by Kenny Rankin.</p>
