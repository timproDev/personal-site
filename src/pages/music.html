title: Music
description: Music has been a part of my life ever since my mom placed speakers on her tummy and played Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty. I still play the tenor saxophone bought by my grandfather from a shop in Manhattan back in 1993. Nowadays I can call myself a mutli-instrumentalist, arranger, composer and performer working across industries such as broadcast TV, mobile game development, indepenednt video and film production. I continue to explore, write and record in Brooklyn.
