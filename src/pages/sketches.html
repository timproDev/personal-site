title: Sketches
description: Sketching is important. Just because there are no sketches on this page does it means that sketching is not important. Sketching is in fact important. I would have uploaded my sketches but I was busy sketching. Also, hey. Sketches can be lyrics and songs as well! But tis page, eventually, will more likely be of the visual form of sketchery.
